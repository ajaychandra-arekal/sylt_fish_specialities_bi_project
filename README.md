By leveraging BI tools, the project aids the company in enhancing customer satisfaction, productivity, and revenue.

### Objectives

- Operational Efficiency: Provide insights into inventory, logistics, and customer behavior to streamline processes and improve decision-making.

### Solution Approach

- Data Integration: Extract data from multiple systems (POS, CRM, inventory, and financial management) and organize it into a star schema for optimal analysis.
- Power BI for Analytics: Utilize Power BI for ETL, data modeling, and visualizations, enabling interactive dashboards and real-time insights for end users.
- Key Analyses: Includes top-selling products by region, popular dish pairings, regional sales trends, and time-based customer preferences.

### Key Insights and Strategic Recommendations
